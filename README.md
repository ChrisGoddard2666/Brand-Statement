# Brand-Statement
Beginning Full Stack Web Developer with  a background in law and running my own business.  I am able to integrate into very diverse personal
and educational experience to be a team player who always aims to do more.  Recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from 
the University of Arizona, with newly developed skills in HTML 5, Bootstrapped, Jquery,  JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web 
design. I am passionate about the users experience when visiting a web site I have developed, and make sure that the technology is 
interactive and most importantly useful; so that the user will buy. My certificate as a Full Stack Web Developer from the University
of Arizona, was both the hardest, and most rewarding thing that I have ever done.  With such a diverse background, I can seamlessly
integrate into any organization, and work best in a team where I can pool my talents to achieve results that overwhelm everybody.  
Having owned a business I know about how important sales and teamwork are in any organization. 
The web-developing skills that I have developed combined with past experience make me the ideal candidate for your team.
